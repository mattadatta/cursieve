Sieve is a Rust library that makes it easy to deserialize byte arrays into annotated Rust structures.

As the name suggests, this library is most useful when you have existing byte data you want to extract non-contiguous information out of and into Rust structures you can freely and easily modify, which can later be reserialized, leaving other bytes untouched.

## Features

Generates `sift` and `disperse` functions that allow you to generate a structure from existing byte data, or deserialize an existing structure across a given byte array.

- Implemented using `std::io::Cursor` and [byteorder](https://crates.io/crates/byteorder), with support for endianness
- Serialize primitives and other Sieve-derived types easily; opt-in other fields with `try_from` support
- Annotate only where needed; Sieve automatically computes the size of your structure and offsets required to serialize; for non-contiguous reading, simply annotate the start of each contiguous section

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sieve = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

Then, in your crate:

```rust
use sieve::Sieve;

#[derive(Sieve)]
struct MyStruct {
    #[sieve(offset(0x8A))]
    my_var: i32,
    // ...
}
```

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use `Sieve`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Sieve)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    #[sieve(offset(0x12), count(7))]
    name: Vec<u8>,
    #[sieve(offset(0x80), try_from(u16))]
    ty: TypeSupportingTryFromPrimitive,
    #[sieve(try_from)]
    garden: Garden,
    happiness: i16,
    init: u8,
    #[sieve(offset(0x8A))]
    lifespan_1: i16,
    lifespan_2: i16,
    #[sieve(order(byteorder::BigEndian))]
    cool_beans: u16,
}


```
